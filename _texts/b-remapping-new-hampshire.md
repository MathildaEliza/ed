title: Remapping New Hampshire



---
-
-
- No wonder poets sometimes have to seem
- So much more‘business-like than business men. -
- Their wares are so much harder to get rid of.

- She’s one of the two best states in the Union.
- Vermont’s the other. And the two have been
- Yoke-fellows in the sap-yoke from of old
- In many Marches. 1 And they lie like wedges,

- Thick end to thin end and thin end to thick e»
- And are a figure of the way the strong
- Of mind and strong of arm should fit together,

- One thick where one is thin and vice versa.

- New Hampshire raises the Connecticut
- In a trout hatchery near Canada,

- But soon divides the river with Vermont.

- Both are delightful states for their absurdly
- Small towns — Lost Nation,[^fn1] Bungey, Muddy Boo,
- Poplin, Still Corners (so called not because
- The place is silent all day long, nor yet
- Because it boasts a whisky still — because
- It set out once to be a city and still /

- Is only corners, cross-roads in a wood).

- And I remember one whose name appeared
- Between the pictures on a movie screen
- Election 2 night once in Franconia,

- When everything had gone Republican
- And Democrats were sore in need of comfort:
- Easton goes Democratic, Wilson 4
- Hughes 2. And everybody to the saddest
- Laughed the loud laugh, the big laugh at the little.
- New York (five million) laughs at Manchester,

- Manchester (sixty or seventy thousand) laughs
- At Littleton (four thousand), Littleton
- Laughs at Franconia (seven hundred), and
- Franconia laughs, I fear, — did laugh that night —

- At Easton. What has Easton left to laugh at,

- And like the actress exclaim, “ Oh my God ” at?
- /There’s Bungeyj and for Bungey there are towns,
- Whole townships named but without population.

- Anything I can say about New Hampshire
- Will serve almost as well about Vermont,

- Excepting that they differ in their mountains.

- The Vermont mountains stretch extended straight}

- New Hampshire mountains curl up in a coil.

- I had been coming to New Hampshire mountains.
- And here I am and what am I to say?

- Here first my theme becomes embarrassing.

- Emerson said, “The God who made New Hampshire
- Taunted the lofty land with little men.”

- Another Massachusetts poet said,

- “ I go no more to summer in New Hampshire.

- I’ve given up my summer place in Dublin.”

- But when I asked to know what ailed New Hampshire,
- She said she couldn’t stand the people in it,

- The little men (it’s Massachusetts speaking).

- And when I asked to know what ailed the people,
- She said, “ Go read your own books and find out.”

- I may as well confess myself the author
- Of several books against the world in general.

- To take them as against a special state
- Or even nation’s to restrict my meaning.
