  <h1>Let's open up the public domain.</h1>

<p>On January 1, 2019, material published in the United States in 1923 entered the public domain after a twenty-year delay due to the extension of copyright terms by Congress. Among the many works of art, film, literature, and music is <a href="https://archive.org/details/NewHampshireRobertFrost1923/page/n9">Robert Frost's <em>New Hampshire</a></em> , the collection of poetry that won him a Pulitzer Prize the following year. The poems in this <a href="https://everybodyslibraries.com/2018/12/31/public-domain-day-advent-calendar-31-new-hampshire-by-robert-frost/">now-iconic collection</a> evoke a place with rocky soils, harsh winters, and the humble, yet determined, Americans who lived there. However, long before New Hampshire was part of the United States,  it comprised part of indigenous Abenaki territory.</p>
